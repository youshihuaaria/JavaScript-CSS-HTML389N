# Exercise 6: In Memory API

## Due Date: Thursday July 9th, 2020 11:59 PM
## Objectives: To become familiar with creating custom endpoints for a REST API, how data is stored and modeled in a REST API,further practice with Javascript Array Methods, and how to properly structure an express API.

## Specifications/Requirements
We have provided you with a complete Express API application. You need to complete the code inside of 2 files: the `Contact.js` class inside of the `models` directory and `contacts.js` inside of `routes/api/v1`. We have provided comments at the top of both files with the requirements.

__Note: In order to run the application run ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` in the top level directory of the exercise. To test your endpoints you will need the use of an external tool like Postman or the use of the Curl command line utility.__
